# Open API Spec and CI/CD to Redocly

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates the use of an OpenAPI specification and the deployment of an API using GitHub Actions. Special thanks to Łukasz Michta for his "CI/CD for Technical Writers with OpenAPI and Redocly" tutorial, which served as the foundation for this project. I adapted and refined the API to align with my use case.

## What is Redocly

Redocly is a platform designed to streamline and enhance the process of creating, managing, and publishing API documentation. Redocly helps generate interactive and visually appealing API documentation from OpenAPI specifications. It transforms raw API definitions into developer-friendly documentation.
