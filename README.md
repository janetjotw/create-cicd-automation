# Open API Spec and CI/CD to Redocly

This repo aims to showcase the OpenAPI specification and deploy the API through GitHub Actions. 
I would like to thank ≈Åukasz Michta for the CI/CD for Technical Writer with Open API-Redocly exercise. I built this Github repo based on this guidance and fine-tuned the API to suit my example.
