# Open API Spec and CI/CD to Redocly

## Introduction

This repo aims to showcase the OpenAPI specification and deploy the API through GitHub Actions. 
I would like to thank Łukasz Michta for the CI/CD for Technical Writer with Open API-Redocly exercise. I built this Github repo based on this guidance and fine-tuned the API to suit my example. 

## What is Redocly

Redocly is a platform designed to streamline and enhance the process of creating, managing, and publishing API documentation. Redocly helps generate interactive and visually appealing API documentation from OpenAPI specifications. It transforms raw API definitions into developer-friendly documentation.
